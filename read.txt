About project info

It's just simple farm base website where I showing listing of product & data which we are seeing
it's come dynamically from data.json file(here data.json file behave like database) cause project
is build using only node js (where i use some concept Es6,own modules,core modules,routing etc) 

Steps to run the project

1) First install node js and npm in your system
2) open your terminal & hit command node project.js(hit enter button);
